              <blockquote>
                GreenPad Concepts project started by providing free sanitary
                pads for school girls after the funder observed the pattern of
                school absenteeism among Nigeria rural girls. He later had the
                opportunity to interview a community teacher on why girls are
                most time out of school;
                <br /> <br />
                the teacher narrowed it down to lack of access to feminine
                hygiene product and its ripple effects on girl’s health and
                education.The founder started by raising funds from personal
                savings, family and friends to provide free sanitary pads;but it
                wasn’t sustainable.That is how the idea of producing local
                sanitary pads set-in.

                GreenPad Concepts started in 2017, by spreading awareness on
                menstrual hygiene, reproductive health, sex education, HIV/AIDS,
                child spacing and family planning through campaigns and speeches
                delivered in schools, communities, neighbourhoods and parishes,
                with the aim to eradicate reproductive tract infections and
                diseases that, when untreated, damages reproductive system.
                Through our relationships with rural women and the communities,
                it
                <br /> <br />
                was recognized that we could engage the women in the production
                line and as sales agents of the finished product with skills
                needed to generate wealth from waste. Since then, we have grown
                our impact to reach more than 35,000 school girls with adequate
                menstrual hygiene, reproductive health tips, with free sanitary
                pad to give them an experience that it better than their old
                <br /> <br />
                alternatives and help keep them in school during their period.
                We have directly impacted over 1,000 women with adequate
                information on reproductive health, child spacing and family
                planning and free sanitary pads as well. 25 women have been
                engaged in the network of cooperative women that manages the
                fibre extraction unit and as sales agents of the finished
                product.

            <h4>
                <em>Problem</em>
              </h4>
              <blockquote>
                In developing countries, most women and girls living in poverty
                cannot afford to buy female sanitary products. They are forced
                to resort to unhygienic alternatives such as rags, foams or
                toilet paper, resulting in various health risks. In Nigeria,
                particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, a lot of girls have
                to miss school for about 4 – 5 days during their menstrual
                period each month. As
                <br /> <br />a result of so much absenteeism, they cannot
                complete their education. Most families living on less than a
                Dollar a day cannot afford to buy western sanitary pads of $1.5
                for their 2 – 4 girls as they are too expensive. Girls lack
                right information on menstruation and feminine hygiene because
                of taboos around menstruation and rural Nigeria has reportedly
                the highest dropout rate in Nigeria resulting from difficulties
                that girls experience when they are menstruating.

                <em>Solution</em>
              </h4>
              <blockquote>
                GreenPad Concepts produce eco-friendly sanitary pads made from
                99% local materials with the main raw material being plantain
                and banana stems fibre, an agricultural by-product that is
                hygienic, good quality and bio-degradable. Best of all, the main
                raw material is abundant all over the country. The sanitary pad
                made by GreenPad Concepts is 60% cheaper than the ones available
                in the market, therefore girls and women from underprivileged
                communities and low-income families can afford them.  GreenPad
                Concepts gives women and girls access to feminine hygiene so
                they can live life
                <br /> <br />
                as they should. Our sustainable sanitary pads are made from
                banana and plantain tree fibres, which farmers would have
                otherwise considered waste. They are fully biodegradable within
                6 months, but most importantly, they are affordable to all
                women, and generate extra income for plantain farmers. Access to
                sanitary pads will decrease absenteeism in school and dropping
                out among girls. The other goal is to create employment to the
                many women without jobs.

          <h3>OUR MODEL</h3>
          <blockquote>
            GreenPad Concepts help rural women form cooperatives that extract
            fibre from banana stalks, an agricultural by-product. GreenPad
            purchase the fibre from the women, as well as employ women to
            produce the pads at its manufacturing facility. The finished product
            are marketed and sold to rural women distributors, local health
            maternity centres, Nigeria’s health and education ministries, and
            national and international non-profit organizations. GreenPad
            Concepts also develop a health education program that raises
            awareness about healthy feminine hygiene and eliminates the stigma
            and taboos surrounding menstruation.
